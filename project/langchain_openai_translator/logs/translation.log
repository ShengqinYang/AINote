 It is barely half a century since parts of the Thames were
declared ‘biologically dead’ because the river was so dirty.But with
the water now cleaner than at any time in living memory,
entrepreneurs want to build a 10 million open-air swimming pool in
the middle of the Thames in Central London.
Purification specialists from Germany – which has the highest water
cleanliness standards in Europe – have designed a system which the
scheme’s backers say will ensure that bathing is safe for visitors
of all ages.
The Thames Baths at Temple Stairs on the Embankment will be
surrounded by reed beds to filter water from the river before it is
pumped into the 82ft by 32ft main lap pool, with a secondary
filtration device underneath the poolside decking.Health concerns
have been raised about the project because of sewage overflows
during heavy rain and the experience of comedian David Walliams, who
suffered a bout of ‘Thames tummy’ during a 140-mile charity swim in
2011.But experts from German firm Polyplan, which has built natural
swimming pools all over Europe, have come up with a solution.Tim
Evans, director of British firm Gartenart, which is working on the
project, said the water – unheated and chlorine-free – will be ‘as
clean as anything you would find in a mountain lake’。
The lido will have changing rooms, a 130ft ramp leading from the
shore to the water, a plunge pool and a children’s paddling area,
while a 4ft-high glass balustrade will protect swimmers from waves
caused by river traffic.Chris Romer-Lee, of Studio Octopi – the
London architects behind the scheme – said he hoped an initial
300,000 to cover consultancy costs and other fees would be raised by
crowd-funding, where members of the public can contribute to
community schemes.
If planning permission is granted, the lido could open late next
year.

 Test Data
This dataset contains two test samples provided by ChatGPT, an AI language model by OpenAI.
These samples include a markdown table and an English text passage, which can be used to test an
English-to-Chinese translation software supporting both text and table formats.
Text testing
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This pangram contains every letter of the English
alphabet at least once. Pangrams are often used to test fonts, keyboards, and other text-related
tools. In addition to English, there are pangrams in many other languages. Some pangrams are more
difficult to construct due to the unique characteristics of the language.

 It is barely half a century since parts of the Thames were
declared ‘biologically dead’ because the river was so dirty.But with
the water now cleaner than at any time in living memory,
entrepreneurs want to build a 10 million open-air swimming pool in
the middle of the Thames in Central London.
Purification specialists from Germany – which has the highest water
cleanliness standards in Europe – have designed a system which the
scheme’s backers say will ensure that bathing is safe for visitors
of all ages.
The Thames Baths at Temple Stairs on the Embankment will be
surrounded by reed beds to filter water from the river before it is
pumped into the 82ft by 32ft main lap pool, with a secondary
filtration device underneath the poolside decking.Health concerns
have been raised about the project because of sewage overflows
during heavy rain and the experience of comedian David Walliams, who
suffered a bout of ‘Thames tummy’ during a 140-mile charity swim in
2011.But experts from German firm Polyplan, which has built natural
swimming pools all over Europe, have come up with a solution.Tim
Evans, director of British firm Gartenart, which is working on the
project, said the water – unheated and chlorine-free – will be ‘as
clean as anything you would find in a mountain lake’。
The lido will have changing rooms, a 130ft ramp leading from the
shore to the water, a plunge pool and a children’s paddling area,
while a 4ft-high glass balustrade will protect swimmers from waves
caused by river traffic.Chris Romer-Lee, of Studio Octopi – the
London architects behind the scheme – said he hoped an initial
300,000 to cover consultancy costs and other fees would be raised by
crowd-funding, where members of the public can contribute to
community schemes.
If planning permission is granted, the lido could open late next
year.
